		<p style="text-align:center">- Our Mission - 
			To educate every day consumers on sustainable energy</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">Conscious Consumers started out as a simple conversation between three college students and eventually morphed into the core of our project.  We realized the internet provided a fountain of information on renewable energy, sustainability actions, and energy cost tools but it was missing something.  The average consumer wants to learn more about renewable energy and sustainability but the amount of information on the subject can be overwhelming.  Thatâ€™s where Conscious Consumers comes in.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">Our website is the critical step for average consumers to become educated on how to make the transition into renewable energy.  Here we make information work for you and incorporate simple tools to help you determine which renewable energy alternatives are right for you.  Additionally, we know that numbers matter and we have provided easy-to-use tools and services to provide customized personal assessments for potential cost savings.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">Let us help you with the first step...</p>
